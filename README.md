# 📊 An Interactive Dashboard for Exploring Any Dataset
Ever have a CSV or Excel file and wish you could quickly explore it, clean it up, and make some charts without writing a ton of code? This project is a simple, all-in-one tool that does just that!

Built with Python and Streamlit, this dashboard lets you turn your raw data into insights in just a few clicks.

What can it do?

1) Bring Your Own Data: Easily upload your .csv or .xlsx file right in the app.

2) Get a Quick Overview: Instantly see a preview of your data, how many rows and columns you're working with, and what kind of data is in each column.

3) Explore Visually: Jump into the visualization explorer to create all kinds of interactive plots (like histograms, bar charts, box plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots) to find patterns and spot outliers.

4) Tidy Up Your Data: Find and fix common data quality issues. You can remove duplicate rows, find missing values, and choose to either drop them or fill them in with the mean, median, or mode.

5) Save Your Work: Once you're done, you can download your newly cleaned dataset or export a quick summary report of all the key statistics.

7) To run this code use this command " streamlit run 'file name' .py ".
